API to download and extract TAMSAT rainfall estimates

The TAMSAT download and extraction API is a Python-based utility that allows users to download TAMSAT rainfall estimates to their local computer and extract rainfall estimates for their own requirements. 

The API is similar to the functionality provided TAMSATâ€™s web-based data subsetting tool (http://www.tamsat.org.uk/data-subset/), but offers users the opportunity to perform these tasks themselves in a Python environment and to configure the API to perform multiple tasks without the need to submit multiple requests through the online data subsetting tool. As such, this API will be useful for those wishing to further their Python skills.

Details on how to operate the API are given in the accompanying document: TAMSAT_Data_Download_and_Extraction_API.pdf.

The API will be continued to be developed to provide additional functionality in the future. Information about updates to the API will be provided here and on the TAMSAT website. If you have any questions about the API, please contact tamsat@reading.ac.uk.
